# Link-Up
LinkUp is a full-stack social networking platform where users can share stories, connect with friends, chat in real time, and interact through likes and comments. It is built with the MERN stack and integrates Clerk for secure authentication. The UI is designed with React + Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean and responsive experience across all devices.
